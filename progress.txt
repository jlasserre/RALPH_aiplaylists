## Codebase Patterns
- Next.js 16.1.2 with App Router (src/app/ directory structure)
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Tailwind CSS v4 with `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `./src/*`
- Jest 30 with next/jest helper for Next.js integration
- Tests co-located with source files (`.test.ts`, `.test.tsx`)
- localStorage is mocked in jest.setup.js - mocks auto-clear before each test
- Web Crypto API (TextEncoder, crypto.subtle) polyfilled in jest.setup.js for jsdom

## 2026-01-15 - US-001
- What was implemented: Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Files changed:
  - package.json - project config with ai-playlist-generator name
  - tsconfig.json - TypeScript config with strict mode
  - src/app/layout.tsx - root layout with metadata
  - src/app/page.tsx - basic home page component
  - src/app/globals.css - Tailwind CSS imports and theme variables
  - eslint.config.mjs - ESLint configuration
  - next.config.ts - Next.js configuration
  - postcss.config.mjs - PostCSS config for Tailwind
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - create-next-app refuses to create projects in directories with capital letters in the name - use temp directory workaround
  - next-env.d.ts is auto-generated and gitignored - don't try to add it
  - Next.js 16 uses Tailwind v4 with new `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax instead of @tailwind directives
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-002
- What was implemented: Installed dependencies and created environment config
- Files changed:
  - package.json - added zustand, @anthropic-ai/sdk, openai dependencies
  - package-lock.json - updated with new dependencies
  - .env.local.example - created with Spotify OAuth and LLM API key placeholders
  - src/types/index.ts - created with comprehensive type definitions (Song, SpotifyTrack, PlaylistSong, CandidateSong, API responses, etc.)
  - .gitignore - added exception for .env.local.example
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - .gitignore has `.env*` pattern that blocks .env.local.example - need to add explicit exception `!.env.local.example`
  - Type definitions created early help maintain consistency across the codebase
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-002b
- What was implemented: Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit and component testing
- Files changed:
  - package.json - added jest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, jest-environment-jsdom, @types/jest, ts-node; added test/test:watch/test:coverage/typecheck scripts
  - jest.config.js - created with next/jest helper, jsdom environment, module aliases
  - jest.setup.js - created with @testing-library/jest-dom import and localStorage mock
  - src/types/index.test.ts - sample test file verifying types and localStorage mock
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `next/jest` helper (createJestConfig) for seamless Next.js integration
  - Jest 30 works with Next.js 16 - no compatibility issues
  - localStorage mock should clear mocks in beforeEach to ensure test isolation
  - The `typecheck` script (`tsc --noEmit`) is useful for CI validation
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-003
- What was implemented: PKCE utility functions for Spotify OAuth
- Files changed:
  - src/lib/spotify/auth.ts - created with generateCodeVerifier, generateCodeChallenge, generateRandomState functions
  - src/lib/spotify/auth.test.ts - comprehensive tests for all PKCE functions
  - jest.setup.js - added TextEncoder, TextDecoder, and crypto.subtle polyfills for Web Crypto API support
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - jsdom environment doesn't include TextEncoder/TextDecoder - import from 'util' and set on global
  - jsdom doesn't have crypto.subtle - use webcrypto from 'crypto' module and define on global.crypto
  - Jest 30 uses `--testPathPatterns` instead of `--testPathPattern` (or just pass file path directly)
  - RFC 7636 PKCE test vector: verifier "dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk" produces challenge "E9Melhoa2OwvFrEMTJguCHaoeK1t8URWbuGJSstw-cM"
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-004
- What was implemented: Spotify OAuth initiation API route
- Files changed:
  - src/app/api/auth/spotify/route.ts - GET handler that generates PKCE values, stores them in httpOnly cookies, and redirects to Spotify authorization
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js 16 cookies() is async - must await the call before using set()
  - Cookie options: httpOnly for security, sameSite 'lax' for OAuth redirects, secure in production only
  - Spotify OAuth scopes: playlist-read-private, playlist-modify-public, playlist-modify-private are needed for this app
  - Store both code_verifier (for token exchange) and state (for CSRF protection) in cookies
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-005
- What was implemented: Spotify OAuth callback API route that completes the PKCE flow
- Files changed:
  - src/app/api/auth/spotify/callback/route.ts - GET handler that exchanges auth code for tokens
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When setting/deleting cookies in a redirect response, use `response.cookies.set()` and `response.cookies.delete()` instead of the `cookies()` store directly
  - Spotify returns tokens as JSON with: access_token, token_type, scope, expires_in, refresh_token
  - Store both refresh_token (30 days) and access_token (expires_in from response) in httpOnly cookies
  - The access_token cookie is temporary - it will be read by /api/auth/refresh on page load
  - Clear temporary OAuth cookies (state, code_verifier) on successful token exchange
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-006
- What was implemented: Token refresh API route for session persistence
- Files changed:
  - src/app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts - POST handler that refreshes access tokens
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Spotify refresh token grant uses `grant_type: 'refresh_token'` with client_id and refresh_token
  - Spotify may return a new refresh_token in the response - update the cookie if so
  - Check for existing access_token cookie first (from OAuth callback) before using refresh_token
  - Clear refresh_token cookie on 400/401 errors (invalid/expired token)
  - Return `expires_in` along with access_token so client knows when to refresh
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-007
- What was implemented: Auth Zustand store for managing Spotify authentication state
- Files changed:
  - src/store/authStore.ts - Zustand store with accessToken, isAuthenticated, isLoading state and actions
  - src/store/authStore.test.ts - 13 tests for all store actions and state transitions
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Zustand stores can be tested by using `useStore.getState()` and `useStore.setState()` directly
  - Reset store state in `beforeEach` using `useStore.setState()` for test isolation
  - Zustand `create<T>()` accepts a generic for full type inference
  - Access token stored in memory only (not persisted) - refresh token is in httpOnly cookie server-side
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-008
- What was implemented: useSpotifyAuth hook with auto-refresh on mount
- Files changed:
  - src/hooks/useSpotifyAuth.ts - hook that auto-refreshes access token on mount, exports login/logout functions
  - src/hooks/useSpotifyAuth.test.ts - 11 tests covering auto-refresh, login, logout, error handling
  - src/store/authStore.ts - added hasAttemptedRefresh state for test isolation
  - src/store/authStore.test.ts - added 4 tests for hasAttemptedRefresh state
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - useRef values persist across Jest tests since the module is cached - use store state instead for flags that need test isolation
  - jsdom's window.location.href cannot be redefined - test login function existence rather than actual navigation behavior
  - React Testing Library's renderHook requires async/await with waitFor for async effects
  - Zustand store state can be reset in beforeEach using `useStore.setState()` for proper test isolation
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-009
- What was implemented: Base UI components with Tailwind CSS
- Files changed:
  - src/components/ui/Button.tsx - button with primary/secondary/ghost variants, sm/md/lg sizes, loading state
  - src/components/ui/Input.tsx - input with label, error, hint support
  - src/components/ui/TextArea.tsx - textarea with character count, label, error, hint
  - src/components/ui/Card.tsx - card with optional header section
  - src/components/ui/Checkbox.tsx - checkbox with label and optional description
  - src/components/ui/index.ts - barrel export for all UI components
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - forwardRef is useful for components that need to accept refs (Button, Input, TextArea, Checkbox)
  - useId() hook generates stable unique IDs for accessibility (label-input association)
  - ARIA attributes: aria-invalid, aria-describedby for form validation
  - Tailwind focus states: focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 for accessibility
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-010
- What was implemented: ThreePanelLayout component for desktop/tablet three-panel UI
- Files changed:
  - src/components/layout/ThreePanelLayout.tsx - responsive three-panel layout with left (narrower), middle, and right panels
  - src/components/layout/index.ts - barrel export for layout components
  - src/app/page.tsx - updated to use ThreePanelLayout with placeholder content
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use flex-shrink-0 for fixed-width panels to prevent them from shrinking
  - Use min-w-0 on flex children to allow proper text truncation
  - overflow-y-auto on panel containers enables independent scrolling per panel
  - The header slot pattern is useful for layout components that need to accept dynamic header content
  - Background color differentiation (bg-gray-50 vs bg-white) helps visually distinguish panels
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-011
- What was implemented: LeftPanel component with playlist controls
- Files changed:
  - src/components/layout/LeftPanel.tsx - full-featured left panel with all required controls
  - src/components/layout/index.ts - added LeftPanel to barrel export
  - src/app/page.tsx - updated to use LeftPanel component
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Custom select styling requires `appearance-none` and a positioned chevron icon
  - The 'use client' directive is needed for components using useState
  - Prompt validation with min/max length can use both TextArea's built-in props and custom error state
  - LLMProvider type should be 'claude' | 'openai' to match PRD requirements
  - The LeftPanel accepts optional callbacks (onNewPlaylist, onLoadExisting, onSuggestSongs) to be wired up by parent
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-012
- What was implemented: MiddlePanel component with CandidateList for displaying song candidates
- Files changed:
  - src/components/layout/MiddlePanel.tsx - panel wrapper with skeleton loading state
  - src/components/features/playlist/CandidateList.tsx - candidate list with checkboxes, empty state, match rate, Add Selected button
  - src/components/features/playlist/index.ts - barrel export for playlist features
  - src/components/layout/index.ts - added MiddlePanel export
  - src/app/page.tsx - updated to use MiddlePanel component
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Checkbox with empty label="" when label is provided separately (ARIA handled via aria-label)
  - CandidateSong type from @/types includes isMatched and isSelected for managing selection state
  - Unmatched songs should be disabled (not selectable) and show "Not found" badge
  - Match rate shown as "X of Y songs found on Spotify" helps user understand search quality
  - Skeleton loaders in MiddlePanel show 6 placeholder cards with animated pulse effect
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-013
- What was implemented: RightPanel component with PlaylistView for displaying accumulated playlist songs
- Files changed:
  - src/components/layout/RightPanel.tsx - panel wrapper with skeleton loading state
  - src/components/features/playlist/PlaylistView.tsx - playlist view with state icons, tooltips, song list, read-only banner, and Create/Update button
  - src/components/features/playlist/index.ts - added PlaylistView export
  - src/components/layout/index.ts - added RightPanel export
  - src/app/page.tsx - updated to use RightPanel component
  - eslint.config.mjs - added jest.config.js and jest.setup.js to globalIgnores to fix lint error
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PlaylistSong type from @/types includes state field with values 'synced' | 'pending' | 'markedForRemoval'
  - Use CSS group/group-hover pattern for showing tooltips on hover without JavaScript
  - Read-only banner uses amber colors (bg-amber-50, border-amber-200, text-amber-800) for warning states
  - Skeleton loaders in RightPanel match MiddlePanel pattern with 6 placeholder cards
  - The eslint.config.mjs needed CommonJS files (jest.config.js, jest.setup.js) in globalIgnores to avoid @typescript-eslint/no-require-imports error
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-014
- What was implemented: SongCard component with state icons and tooltips
- Files changed:
  - src/components/features/playlist/SongCard.tsx - reusable song card with state icons (synced, pending, markedForRemoval), tooltips, and click handler
  - src/components/features/playlist/PlaylistView.tsx - updated to use SongCard component instead of inline rendering
  - src/components/features/playlist/index.ts - added SongCard export
  - src/app/page.tsx - added demo data for development testing (demoPlaylistSongs, demoCandidateSongs)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Extract reusable components (like SongCard) when rendering patterns are duplicated across components
  - State icons with tooltips can use CSS group/group-hover pattern for hover effects
  - The SongCard component supports both playlist (with state icons) and candidate (without state icons) use cases via props
  - Demo data in page.tsx is useful for visual testing during development before stores are wired up
  - Separate icon components (SyncedIcon, PendingIcon, MarkedForRemovalIcon) improve readability and maintainability
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-015
- What was implemented: LLM types and prompt templates for song generation
- Files changed:
  - src/types/song.ts - created with Song interface (title, artist, album?, year?), LLMSongGenerationResponse, and LLMPlaylistNameResponse
  - src/lib/llm/prompts.ts - created with SONG_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT (instructs LLM to return JSON array of songs), PLAYLIST_NAME_SYSTEM_PROMPT, buildSongGenerationPrompt(), buildPlaylistNamePrompt(), and LLMGenerationConfig types
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Song interface already existed in src/types/index.ts but creating dedicated src/types/song.ts provides clearer separation for LLM-specific types
  - System prompts should explicitly instruct the LLM to return only JSON without markdown formatting or additional text
  - LLMGenerationConfig includes songCount, maxTokens, and temperature for customizing generation behavior
  - Default song generation targets 20 songs with temperature 0.7 for balanced creativity
  - Playlist name generation uses higher temperature (0.8) for more creative names
---

## 2026-01-15 - US-016
- What was implemented: Claude LLM client for song generation
- Files changed:
  - src/lib/llm/claude.ts - ClaudeClient class with generateSongs() and generatePlaylistName() methods
  - src/lib/llm/claude.test.ts - 23 tests covering song generation, name generation, and error handling
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Anthropic SDK v0.71+ uses `messages.create()` with model, max_tokens, system, and messages params
  - Response structure: `response.content` is an array of blocks - find `type: 'text'` block and access `.text`
  - ClaudeAPIError custom class with statusCode and isRetryable properties helps callers handle errors appropriately
  - 429 (rate limit) and 5xx (server errors) should be marked as retryable; 401 (auth) should not
  - Mock Anthropic.APIError in tests by creating object with `status` property and setting prototype to APIError.prototype
  - LLM may return markdown code blocks despite instructions - always strip ```json...``` from responses
  - Validate Song objects by checking title/artist are non-empty strings; filter out invalid songs from response
