# AI Playlists

This project is being built following the [Getting Started With Ralph](https://www.aihero.dev/getting-started-with-ralph) tutorial from AI Hero.

I will build a web app that creates a spotify playlist based on the input provided by the user. It will use chatgpt or another LLM to generate the list of songs based on the user's description. It will then access my spotify account to create a new playlist containing these songs.

## About Ralph

Ralph is an autonomous AI agent loop technique that runs Claude Code repeatedly until all PRD (Product Requirements Document) items are complete. The AI picks its own tasks from a PRD, commits after each feature, and continues until the work is done.
